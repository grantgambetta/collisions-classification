# Classification of Collisions

A gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) to classify different types of car collisions out of 8 categories: rear end, broadside, sideswipe, hit object, head-on, pedestrian, overturned, or other.

Dataset contains over 9 million records and 74 features before preprocessing.

Next step: fine-tune the model using grid search.
